### Breast Cancer Detection Using Machine Learning
Overview
This project implements a machine learning model to predict breast cancer based on clinical features. It uses a dataset containing various attributes derived from patient images to classify tumors as benign or malignant.

Features
Upload CSV: Users can upload a CSV file containing patient data for prediction.
Prediction: The model predicts whether a tumor is benign or malignant based on uploaded data.
Summary Statistics: Displays summary statistics and diagnosis breakdown after prediction.
Download Results: Provides an option to download the prediction results as a CSV file.
Dependencies
Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

pandas
streamlit
joblib
Install dependencies using:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas streamlit joblib
Usage
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your_username/breast-cancer-detection.git
cd breast-cancer-detection
Run the Streamlit app:

bash
Copy code
streamlit run app.py
Upload CSV file:

Navigate to the provided Streamlit URL.
Click on the file uploader and select a CSV file with patient data.
View Predictions:

Once the file is uploaded, predictions will be displayed.
Summary statistics and diagnosis breakdown will be shown.
Download Predictions:

After viewing predictions, download the results as a CSV file using the provided button.
Files Included
app.py: Streamlit application code for breast cancer prediction.
best_model.pkl: Serialized machine learning model (Random Forest or other classifier).
automl_tpot.py: Script for automated machine learning (optional).
Additional Notes
Ensure the CSV file uploaded contains columns with the following names: radius_mean, texture_mean, perimeter_mean, area_mean, smoothness_mean, compactness_mean, concavity_mean, concave points_mean, symmetry_mean, fractal_dimension_mean, radius_se, texture_se, perimeter_se, area_se, smoothness_se, compactness_se, concavity_se, concave points_se, symmetry_se, fractal_dimension_se, radius_worst, texture_worst, perimeter_worst, area_worst, smoothness_worst, compactness_worst, concavity_worst, concave points_worst, symmetry_worst, fractal_dimension_worst.
The model used in this project can be customized or replaced with other machine learning classifiers as per requirements.
